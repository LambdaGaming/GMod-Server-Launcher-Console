# Garry's Mod Server Launcher GUI With Console Support
 This is meant to act as a replacement launcher for hosts who want to use the full console while also wanting to choose the map the server starts on, since the normal server GUI doesn't include that feature.

## Features:
<ul>
    <li>Prompts the user to select the file path that contains the server exe if the path is not found.</li>
    <li>Console mode toggle. Disables all other options if disabled since the main server GUI will take over at that point and ignore all launch arguments.</li>
    <li>Map selection that gets the names of maps inside the garrymod/maps server folder.</li>
	<li>Support for the new Steam server tokens requirement so the server isn't stuck at the bottom of the server browser.</li>
    <li>Gamemode selection that gets the names of gamemodes inside the garrysmod/gamemodes server folder.</li>
    <li>LAN mode toggle.</li>
    <li>Max players selection.</li>
    <li>Password option.</li>
    <li>All settings mentioned above are saved when the app closes and will be automatically set when the app is reopened.</li>
</ul>

## Working with more than one server:
 If you need this program to run more than one server, you can copy the exe and rename it to something else to generate a new config, allowing you to basically have an unlimited number of configs for the same program.

## Extra Builds:
 I have a separate repository for the launchers that I personally use. These are not very customizable and the the configs are all hard-coded, but feel free to use them if you'd like. [Click here to go to the repository.](https://github.com/LambdaGaming/GMod-Server-Launcher-Console-Extra)
